      It will return a status code along with any data in JSON format.
      It will return HTTP status code 200 OK if the web server finds information, and 404 Not Found if it doesn't find anything.
    <br/><a href="/~wad1903/location/Hampshire">Location search on it's own</a><br/>

    <p>Again it uses the same HTTP status codes as before.
    <br/><a href="/~wad1903/location/Hampshire/type/hotel">Type and Location searching together</a><br/>

    <p>I have used post data in order to do booking so you cannot test from just a URL.
      To test this, please visit <a href="search.html">search.html</a>, search for a location eg Hampshire and then click to book and enter
      Day: 1, Month: 4, Year: 2020 with any amount of people.
      This post data includes ID of the accommodation, amount of people, and the date in YYMMDD format.
      This also uses HTTP status codes 200 and 404 for the same reasons.
      This includes status code 201 which signifies Creation, and 400 to signify no data exists.<br/>


    <br/>This is a list of all pages:
